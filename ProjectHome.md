Our goal is to develop a small portable GPS receiver for Sandia Labs. This is a continuation of the project worked on by a team at the University of Utah in 2008-2009, which  is described below.


Abstract for the 2008-2009 team:
In our partnership with the Sandia National Laboratories in 2008-2009, building a low power GPS tracking system unit for the Sandiaâ€™s based device, which not only had to be compatible with the other boards that were made by Sandia National Laboratories, it also had to be capable of capturing a short sample of GPS satellite signal and store the data into the serial flash memory, has been accomplished. The project has covered the hardware design, software design, board design, board fabrication and the testing through the development of a GPS tracking system unit.
